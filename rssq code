//INDIRA ASKAUKAR
function out = rssq(in, orientation)
//rssq:   Root sum squared value.

//  OUT=rssq(IN)

//  The function calculates the square root of the sum of values of input vector IN.

//  If the input IN is a matrix, the output of function is rssq value of each column stored in a row vector OUT.

//  When the orientation is not specified for N dimensional array, it is taken as the index of the first dimension of IN that is greater than 1 and calculation is done along that orientation.


//  OUT=rssq(IN,orientation)

//  When the orientation is specified the output is calculated along that dimension.

//  The orientation can be specified as 1 for rssq value of columns of matrix IN or as r

//For rssq value of rows of matrix orientation should be 2 or c.

//  When the elements of IN are COMPLEX, the absolute value of the element is used to calculate the output.

//EXAMPLES:
//1)To calculate rssq of a vector:
//IN=[2 4 6]
//OUT=rssq(IN)
//The output should be 7.4833148

//2)To calculate rssq of rows of matrix:
//IN=[1 3 5;2 4 6;7 8 9]
//OUT=rssq(IN,2) or OUT=rssq(IN,'c')
//The output should be OUT=
    //5.9160798  
    //7.4833148  
    //13.928388

//3)To calculate rssq of a columns of complex matrix:
//IN=[5+%i*3 2+%i*4; 3+%i*6 1+%i*2]
//OUT=rssq(IN,1) or OUT=rssq(IN,'r')
//THe output should be OUT= 8.8881944 5.
